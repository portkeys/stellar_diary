        title: "Milky Way over Uruguayan Lighthouse",
        explanation: "The first step to capturing this striking image of a lighthouse in front of the Milky Way was to find a lighthouse in front of the Milky Way. So this industrious photographer went to a small island off the coast of Uruguay to the 19th century Valizas Lighthouse and took many shots with the camera aimed toward the south. The featured image, taken in mid-August, combined these shots to reveal the central region of our Milky Way Galaxy, including many dark dust and bright emission nebulas. The Small Magellanic Cloud is visible above on the right. The 24-meter stone lighthouse was intentionally blurred by the high wind that occurred during long exposures. Light from the Valizas Lighthouse aided fishermen and sailors until 1976, and the structure continues to stand even though its light has been disabled.",

        title: "Morning Glory Clouds",
        explanation: "These long, layered and strange clouds were photographed over Jornada del Muerto, New Mexico, USA, in November 2022. A relatively rare phenomenon, such clouds were only formally identified as recently as 1940 when noted by Royal Australian Air Force pilots flying over northeastern Australia. These atmospheric internal gravity waves are now known to form when humid air cools suddenly, causing water droplets to condense. The resulting heavier air falls into the previously less-dense air beneath it, creating a wave. Successive waves can then form, causing the crests of these waves to spread out in parallel layers where the air is rising, cooling, and condensing into newly visible clouds. The most common locations for these morning glory clouds occur during late summer over northeastern Australia and the central United States.",

        title: "The Northern Summer Milky Way",
        explanation: "The Milky Way is massively bright in the featured image, but it's also massively faint. The reason for the brightness is that the featured 12-panel mosaic shows the Milky Way from Sagittarius through Cygnus, a region containing numerous complex regions of star formation and rich dust bands. The reason for the faintness is that band of light from our own galaxy actually appears in very high and dark skies, from a location typically far from city lights. How dim? The featured panorama is a digital combination of over 200 images taken over 8 days, each with an exposure time of up to 300 seconds. To see the Milky Way yourself, wait for a clear night, find the darkest sky you can, and look up. Although visible in both the northern and southern sky, in the north, August provides the best nighttime months for Milky Way viewing.",
