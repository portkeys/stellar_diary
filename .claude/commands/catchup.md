Read the CLAUDE.md file in the project root and provide a brief status update:

1. Summarize the project purpose and tech stack (2-3 sentences)
2. List the most recent changes from the "Recent Changes" section
3. Check git status and recent commits to see if there's anything new since the last update
4. Highlight any important development notes or pending items

Keep the response concise - this is a quick catch-up, not a deep dive.
