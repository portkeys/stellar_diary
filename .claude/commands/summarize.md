Update the CLAUDE.md file with the latest project state:

1. Read the current CLAUDE.md
2. Check git log for recent commits since the last documented change
3. Update the "Recent Changes" section with new entries (format: `- **YYYY-MM-DD:** Brief description`)
4. Update the "Last Updated" date at the top
5. If there were significant structural changes (new files, patterns, dependencies), update the relevant sections
6. Keep entries concise and actionable

After updating, show me a summary of what changed.
