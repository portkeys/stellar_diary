# Future Improvement Ideas

A collection of ideas for future enhancements to StellarDiary.

## 1. Calendar View for Observations

Add a calendar view to visualize observation days at a glance.

**Features:**
- Monthly calendar showing days with observations
- Click on a day to see that day's observations
- Visual indicators for observation quality or weather conditions

---

## 2. Monthly Guide Refactor

Remove admin mode and restructure into two goal-oriented sections:

### Our Solar System
- Track progress toward observing all planets
- Planet visibility information
- Best viewing times and conditions

### Deep Sky Objects (Messier Challenge)
- Track progress through the Messier catalog (110 objects)
- Object visibility by season/month
- Difficulty ratings and telescope requirements

**Rationale:** Since this is a personal site with a single editor, admin mode adds unnecessary complexity. The new structure aligns with concrete observational goals.

## 3. Progress Tracking

Display progress toward astronomy goals:

### Solar System Progress
- Visual tracker showing which planets have been observed
- 8 planets (or 9 if including Pluto as a bonus)
- Date of first observation for each

### Messier Challenge Progress
- Progress bar or counter (X / 110 complete)
- List view with observed/not observed status
- Filter by object type (galaxy, nebula, cluster)
- Sort by difficulty, magnitude, or constellation
