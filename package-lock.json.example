# Package Lock Information

The `package-lock.json` file is included in this repository to ensure consistent dependency versions across all environments. This file is automatically generated and should not be manually edited.

## For Developers

When setting up locally:
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies from package-lock.json
2. Package-lock.json ensures everyone gets the same dependency versions

## For Deployment

Most deployment platforms (Render, Railway, Vercel) will automatically use package-lock.json to install exact dependency versions, ensuring your deployed app matches your development environment.
